<p><strong>Let’s make the Hungry Fish swim around the sea!</strong></p>
<section id="activity-checklist" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start a new Scratch project.</li>
<li>Select the Stage, then select the Stage’s Backdrop tab. Import the<br />background <strong>Nature/underwater3</strong> using <code class="blocklightgrey">choose background from library</code>. Finally, remove <strong>backdrop1</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the name of Sprite1 to ‘Hungry Fish’ by clicking on the blue ‘i’ symbol.</li>
<li>Import Hungry Fish’s costume, <strong>resources/hungry-fish.png</strong> then remove its existing <strong>costume1</strong> and <strong>costume2</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the blue ‘<strong>i</strong>’ symbol again, and make sure the sprite can only flip left-right.</li>
<li>Now create a script for Hungry Fish to follow the mouse around the sea like this:</li>
</ol>

<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p><strong>Click the green flag.</strong><br />Move the mouse pointer around the sea. Does the fish follow the pointer?<br />What happens if you don’t move the mouse pointer and the fish catches up with it? What does it look like? Why does it do this?</p>
<ol>
<li>You can stop the Hungry Fish flipping like crazy if you make it only move when it’s not too near the mouse pointer<br />(The <code class="blocklightblue">distance to</code> block is in the <code class="blocklightgrey">Sensing</code> palette).</li>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<p>If you want, you can put different numbers in the script. How does that change how Hungry Fish moves? Change the distance threshold to a large number (e.g. 100), or a small number (e.g. 1). Change the amount the fish moves to a large number (e.g. 20) or a small number (e.g. 1 or even 0).</p>

<li>Create a new sprite from the library, using <strong>Animals/starfish</strong>.</li>

<h1>STEP 3: Hungry Fish eats the prey</h1>
<p><strong>Now we want to make the Hungry Fish eat the prey!</strong> Once the Hungry Fish has caught the prey in its mouth, two things need to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hungry Fish needs to close its mouth and make a “chomp” sound.</li>
<li>The prey needs to disappear, then reappear a short while later.</li>
</ul>
<section id="activity-checklist-2" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>First, let’s make the prey disappear if it is touching the Hungry Fish, and then reappear 3 seconds later. Use the <code class="blocklightblue">touching</code> block to see if it is touching the fish.</li>
</ol>

        if on edge, bounce
        if &lt;touching [Hungry Fish v]?&gt; then
            hide
            wait (3) secs
            show" /></p>
</section>
<section id="test-your-project-2" class="level2 flag">
<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p><strong>Try out your game again – can you spot any problems?</strong> Notice that the prey disappears no matter where it touches the Hungry Fish. Also, the fish could just wait 3 seconds and eat the prey the moment it reappears – this isn’t very fair!</p>
<ol>
<li>How could we make sure the prey only disappears if it is touching the Hungry Fish’s mouth? Well, we could use the <code class="blocklightblue">touching color</code> block, and see if it is touching the fish’s blue teeth. To do this, replace the <code class="blocklightblue">touching</code> block with a <code class="blocklightblue">touching color</code> block in your script, click on the color in the block and then click again on the fish’s teeth.</li>
<li>Next we can make the prey move to a random point on the screen before reappearing using a <code class="blockblue">go to</code> block, and giving it a random value for <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>.</li>
</ol>

        if &lt;touching color [#FFFFFF]?&gt; then
            hide
            wait (3) secs
            go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y: (pick random (-170) to (170))
            show" /></p>
</section>
<section id="test-your-project-3" class="level2 flag">
<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p>Try the game again – does the prey only vanish when it touches the fish’s mouth? And does it re-appear in a random point on the screen instead of where it was eaten?</p>
<ol>
<li>The fish needs to know when it has eaten something so it can play a sound and change its skin. To do this, we can have the prey <code class="blockyellow">broadcast</code> the fact that it’s been eaten before vanishing.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="a8fc4de49458e4a8355a114fa543f8726a05a50d.png" alt="

    turn right &lt;pick random (-20) to (20)&gt; degrees
    if on edge, bounce
    if &lt;touching color [#FFFFFF]?&gt;
        broadcast [got me v]
        hide
        wait (3) secs
        go to x:&lt;pick random (-220) to (220)&gt; y: &lt;pick random (-170) to (170)&gt;
        show
    " /></p>
<p><strong>Now we want the fish to respond to this message by making a “chomp” sound and snapping its jaws.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add the <strong>resources/mouth-closed.png</strong> costume and the <strong>resources/chomp.mp3</strong> sound to the Hungry Fish sprite.</li>
<li>Then, add a new script to the Hungry Fish to respond to the message <code class="blockyellow">broadcast</code> by the prey. This script should make the fish play the <strong>‘chomp’</strong> sound and <code class="blockpurple">switch to</code> the mouth-closed costume, wait briefly and then switch back.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="23d3179ded053b5ca7880f47a9fd94024446d453.png" alt="when I receive [got me v]
    play sound [chomp v]
    repeat (2)
        switch to costume [mouth-closed v]
        wait (0.5) secs
        switch to costume [hungry-fish v]" /></p>
<p><strong>Now our Hungry Fish is ready to eat, let’s fill the ocean with prey. Right-click on the prey sprite and click “duplicate” several times.</strong></p>

<h2>Things to think about</h2>
<p>Why do we need to add a <code class="blockblue">show</code> block to the start of the prey’s script? Think about what would happen if the prey is eaten, then the game is stopped before it reappears. What would happen if the game was restarted then?</p>
<p><strong>Well done you’ve finished the basic game. There are more things you can do to your game though. Are you ready for a challenge?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="challenge-1-make-the-prey-move-differently" class="level2 challenge">
<h2>Challenge 1: Make the prey move differently</h2>
<p>At the moment, all the prey move in the same way. <strong>Can you make one of them move differently?</strong> <strong>Hint:</strong> Don’t spend too long on this bit without looking at the other activities in this project.</p>
<p><strong>Pick one of the prey to experiment on.</strong> If they have the same costumes, make it a different colour with the <code class="blockpurple">set color effect</code> block. That way, you can tell it apart from the rest of the prey.</p>
<p>Make this prey move slower than the others. <strong>Hint:</strong> Look at the <code class="blockblue">move 2 steps</code> block.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-your-project-5" class="level2 flag">
<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p>Does the prey move slower? Does this make the game better?<br />If you can do that, <strong>try making one of the prey move quicker than the others.</strong></p>
<p>Does the prey still move in a sensible way? Do these changes make the game better?<br /><strong>Hint:</strong> If your prey swims around in circles, check the values of the <code class="blockgreen">pick random</code> block in the <code class="blockblue">turn</code> block.</p>
<p>How about you make each of the prey behave differently, using different combinations of these changes?</p>
<p>Do any of these changes make the game better? Do they make the game more interesting, more fun, harder, or easier? Are any of those “better”?</p>

</section>
<section id="challenge-2-make-the-prey-avoid-the-hungry-fish" class="level2 challenge">
<h2>Challenge 2: Make the prey avoid the Hungry Fish</h2>
<p>The prey in this game are really stupid! They just swim around randomly until they’re eaten. Real prey swim away from predators. <strong>Let’s make one of the prey swim away from the Hungry Fish.</strong></p>
<p>There’s no block in Scratch that tells you the direction that another sprite is in. But you can make one sprite point towards another, then make it turn around to face away. The blocks you need are in the <code class="blocklightgrey">Motion</code> palette.</p>
<p>Using that idea, <strong>make one of the prey always point away from the Hungry Fish.</strong></p>
<p>You might find that your prey gets stuck in the corner if it is always swimming away from the fish. You might want to have the prey only try to escape when the fish gets close. <strong>Hint:</strong> Look back at how we used the <code class="blocklightblue">distance to</code> block ealier in the game.</p>

<p>It’s not enough just to eat lobsters. How do you know you’re better at the game than your friends? <strong>You need a way to keep score so lets add a score board.</strong> Look at the <strong>Keep Score scratch card</strong> for an idea of how to do it.</p>
<p>Where should you put the block that changes the score?</p>
<p>Make sure the score goes back to zero at the start of the game. Where should you put that block?</p>

</section>
<section id="test-your-project-8" class="level2 flag">
<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p>Does the timer start at 30?</p>

<h2>Challenge 5: Add a bonus score</h2>
<p>Award a large bonus score if you can eat all three lobsters at the same time. How can you tell how many prey have been eaten?</p>

<h2>Challenge 6: Change the game: keep a prey alive!</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you can have great new ideas by taking an existing idea and doing the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>Modify the game so that, instead of you controlling a fish that tries to eat the others, you control one prey in a sea with lots of Hungry Fish.</strong> How long can you last before you’re eaten? Instead of having a score, how about giving the prey 3 lives and ending the game when they’re all gone?</p>
